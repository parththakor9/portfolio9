    <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-bio">
        I am 19 years old, born on January 15, 2005, in Gujarat, India. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by coding and technology, always curious about how things work and how to create new solutions. After completing my 12th grade, I moved to Canada to pursue further studies, scoring a remarkable 7.5 bands in IELTS. During my school years, I consistently scored above 90%, including in my 10th and 12th board exams.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I am a student at Georgian College, where I have been excelling academically and made it to the Dean's List in both my 1st and 3rd semesters. I'm passionate about coding and the world of software development, which motivates me to continuously improve my skills. My journey includes learning about various programming languages, algorithms, and how technology can make a difference in everyday life.
        <br><br>
        Besides my studies, I am also involved in various projects that allow me to put theory into practice, solving real-world problems and building applications that excite me. Iâ€™m particularly interested in web development, creating seamless user experiences, and designing backend systems that make things work efficiently.
        <br><br>
        In the future, I aspire to work in a dynamic tech environment where I can contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and keep pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve. My ultimate goal is to transform my passion into a meaningful career where I can make a positive difference through technology.
